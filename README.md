```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Verridian-ai/life-os-Pulse-banner-generator.git
cd life-os-Pulse-banner-generator

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables

### Database Setup (For Deployment)

The app uses Supabase PostgreSQL for storing user profiles and application data. As the app owner, you need to set up the database schema once.

#### One-Time Setup

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project → SQL Editor
3. Run the schema from `database/schema.sql`
4. Verify tables created (see `database/README.md`)

Once this is done, all users can sign up and use the app with full functionality:
- User profiles stored per user
- API keys stored encrypted per user
- Designs and generation history saved per user

See `database/README.md` for detailed instructions.
